2. Note:
    1) SONY_IMX327_2L_MIPI_2M_30FPS_12BIT and SONY_IMX327_2L_MIPI_2M_30FPS_12BIT_WDR2TO1 timings need to connect to a 2 lane + 2 lane conversion board, so that SONY_IMX327 can work normally.
    2) sample_vio 8,  need at /mpp/sample/hi3516cv500/vio  to run ./smp/sample_vio 8, because yuv file need read at relative content.
